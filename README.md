# MorseToDraw
Converts plaintext to morse code and draws it using Turtle.

11/23 - Currently the code does not allow for the user to input text with line breaks. I would like to change the code to take each line as an input to a larger master String which is then input as the string to convert into morse. This would allow me to input larger strings of text from web documents without having to go in and manually adjust the text line by line.
